# stuorg
 A student organizer, that helps students to organizer their notes, assignments, and timetable. 

Students can:

- Register
- Login
- Create Courses
- Create Notes
- Create Assignments
- Create Semester timetable

The purpose of this web application project is to understand how web apps are developed using PHP | MySQL | Apache. Also, to understand the vulnerabilities that exits in these technologies and how to fix them.

Accordingly, the aim is to deploy this web app unto my LAMP stack and start attacking it with different attack vectors to see which ones are applicable to applications built on these technologies.

There will be different levels of users with different privileges such as;

- Admins: manage the platform by viewing registered students, assign them storage capacity, notify them to update passwords, delete expired timetables and assignments, and move notes to archive. Can also carry out this functions on behave of the students and notify them of the changes, except for passsword update. 

- Standard Students: can register and login to their accounts, create courses, notes and timetables, delete expired notes and timetable, update password from time to time. 

- Premium Students: All of the standard student capabilities plus the ability to share notes and collaborate on assignments.

Unlike a ctf or challenge labs where users are ranked by flags found or challenges completed, this platform will have a Stuorg Researcher platform where researchers will submit reports of vulnerabilities found and be ranked based on different factors such as approach, POC, report, severity of vulnerability found, etc. This is to help begginer researchers understand how real life pentesting works and help them build practical skill set.
